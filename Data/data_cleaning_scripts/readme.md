# Data Cleaning Scripts
This folder contains scripts that clean data files so they can be used in classification models. Data cleaning scripts should take inputs from `../preliminary_data/` and ouput files to `../cleaned_data/` if the data has been sufficiently processed. When adding files to this directory, please be sure to update this readme file with a description of the script:
