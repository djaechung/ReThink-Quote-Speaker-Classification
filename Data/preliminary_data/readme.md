# Preliminary Data
In the original repo, this folder housed preliminary data that needed to be cleaned and pre-processed before being used in classification models. Open distribution of this data was not permitted, so in this public repo the data is witheld.

Contents would have been:
* `gni88 02DEC21.json.zip` - json version of the data, containing quote text and labelled meta-data, such as speaker type and quote topic
* `GNI88.csv` - csv version of the data, containing quote text and labelled meta-data, such as speaker type and quote topic
