# Speaker Classification
This folder is for the development of a model that classifies the speaker of a quote in a news article, i.e., whether the speaker is an elected political official, political analyst, religious figure, military personnel, etc. As the model develops, please be sure to update this readme file with features, file inputs/outputs, descriptions of notebooks, etc.
