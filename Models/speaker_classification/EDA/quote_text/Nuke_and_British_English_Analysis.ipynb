How do you think the Israelis feel right now?

I think the sanctions are working and that's why the discussions have started. But, you know, we need to see what they're going to actually do. We need to see rolling back the nuclear program, and I can tell you that when the time comes, when those movements come, any changes will have to be proportionate.
